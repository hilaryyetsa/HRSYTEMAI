# HRSYTEMAI
This project involves the design and development of an intelligent human resources management system that centralizes, automates, and secures key HR processes while integrating artificial intelligence to assist users, provide information through an external API, and support decision-making within a digitalized HR environment.
- PHP: main backend language, used to implement business logic, manage users and HR modules, and integrate the OpenAI API.

- CodeIgniter (PHP Framework): structures the application using the MVC architecture, ensuring maintainability, security, and scalability.

- MySQL: database management system used to securely store HR information.

- SQL: query language used to manipulate and retrieve HR data.

- HTML5: used to structure web interfaces (pages, forms, tables, chatbot interface).

- CSS3 / Bootstrap 5: used for styling and responsive design of the application.

- JavaScript: enables dynamic user interactions and manages the local chatbot engine.

- AJAX / jQuery: allows asynchronous communication between the frontend and backend.

- JSON: data exchange format between system components and the OpenAI API.

- UML: modeling language used to design and document the system architecture.
